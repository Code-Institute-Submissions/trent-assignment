Wuhan Travel Plan Response Website Design

Stream One Project: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute
The project showcases my coding skills and approach to design.

Technologies
HTML5
CSS5
Bootstrap (4.3.1)

Intro
My project is to imagine myself as tour plan agency of my hometown, Wuhan in China.
As the product is on tourism on Wuhan, the main goal is to provide the good plans for the potential customers. Photos are the key driver of the content with commentary of each photo to provide information to prospective tourists the beauty of Wuhan and the packages the tour agency offers along with a contact information.

I want to provide the capabilities to design a website according to the nature of the product via a user friendly approach. I want to show that I understand the importance of design and the coding skills I have to implement the design I envision.

Features
This site uses the feature to ensure the optimal UI experience regardless of devices used to access the site.

Future enhancements 
At the point of the project, I was not taught javascript and database. However, I envision with the skills I was taught in later classes of the course, I could add functions in buttons so that them can work.
 
Testing
The website navigation is clear and provide the optimal information for people looking to have a holiday in Wuhan and how to contact the tour agency to book or for further information.

This site was tested across multiple mobile devices to ensure compatibility and responsiveness. 

Deployment
This site is hosted using GitHub pages, deployed directly from the master2 branch. 

To run locally, you can clone this repository directly into the editor of your choice by pasting git clone https://github.com/WenlingDing/trent-assignment/tree/master2 into your terminal.
